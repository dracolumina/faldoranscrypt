Release Date.  Novermber 1st.  Well unless a lot of people want it released on Halloween.
Bear with me as my graphical skills are not the greatest and this is my first coin.  It is a simple scrypt coin


This coin will be for trading as well as in the use of a game I am developing.  As I do not want to premine the initial sales from this security will go to purchasing the coin on an exchange for bounties and for the second part of the project.  As well as a pool to mine it.  Half of the pool fees will be converted to BTC and payed as Dividends.  The other half of the pool fees will go towards the jackpot of the game.

The second part of the project is I am developing a web based game. 

This will be a round based Army battle type game set in a fantasy world.  It will be broken down into 10 to 14 day rounds.  At the end of the round each player will have a "score" and the winner will get the jackpot.

Everyone will start out with a free account which will receive a certain number of turns to spend.  There will also be a subscription model where people will start out with a larger number of turns.  Turns will replenish over time (with a cap so they can't just log on and walk away for 10 days and come back with a huge amount) with the subscribers getting more per hour and a higher cap.

Free and Sub users will be able to purchase additional turns using a scrypt based Cryptocoin that I am currently developing, which will be released before the game is done.  The jackpot will be payed out in the coin of the game.  Half of all proceeds from sales of turns and subscriptions will go towards the Jackpot of the current round.  The other half will have operating expenses subtracted from it and the remaining balance payed out to shareholders (if a security is set up) and/or partners evenly.


There will be various aspects of the game at the start (more will be added later).  There will three fighting units and three production units.

Each turn spent will "recruit" a certain number of fighter and production units. 

Fighter (high defense, Low attack)Bowmen (mid-range)Wizards (high attack, low defense)Mana producer (high value yield)Armorers (mid-range yield)Farmer (low value yield)
Each  is a category that they can choose to spend turns in.  They can spend as many as they want in whichever category that they want to but they have to take both the units in that category (no mix and match, IE no Bowmen and Mana producers).


There will be a "game currency" that they can sell producible at as well as buy different kinds of "gear" for their fighters.  This portion is still in drafting stage and have not decided on final items yet.  Each person can be attacked by another (as long as the person is not in the clan/guild if it is implemented) and if they are in the same "value range" so that as a high value cannot attack a low value.  This restriction will be lifted if it is a lower value person attacking a higher value.


To have your producers create things you will also have to spend turns.  Each thing created will have a "set amount" with a small variable added to it.  Eg. 100 farmers would produce 100 + random of 10% food.

At the end of the round the score will be decided using a scoring system where everything is given an in-game currency value. IE
(numbers are just for example, value still need to be decided and balanced out)
10 fighters would be 100 currency
15 mages would be 300 currency
1100 bread would be 1100 currency
10 swords (for the fighters) would be 50 currency

total currency = 1550 currency.  Which would be that persons score (actual numbers would be a lot higher).  In the case of a tie, the one with the most "fighting" units would win top spot.  2nd and 3rd place winners could also receive a "coin" price and those under that up to 10 would get "bonus turns" in their next game.


To avoid premine I intend to use funds drawn in from my security at https://coinsortium.co/security.php?ticker=FALD IF that fails, I will only premine for a short period before I open it to the public.  And it will only be for way less than 1% of total coins.

My goal in the future is to have games developed for each algo of coins out there that will use them with a culmination of my efforts into a final game that will be quite large with each region using its own "local currency" of each coin I develop.  As this is my first coin and a learning process for me I decided to do an easy scrypt coin.
